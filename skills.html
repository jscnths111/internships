            <ol>
                <li><strong>Arrive for your interview about 15 minutes in advance.</strong>  Make sure you take a trial commute to the interviewing spot if you are unsure of the location or how long it might take to park.</strong></li><br>
                <li><a href="https://youtu.be/gF4Y0U8Gvdk"><strong><em>First impressions have a high impact.</em></a></strong>  The employer will be especially concerned with your appearance if you are in a customer contact position.</li><br>
                <li><strong>The receptionist, secretary, or another staff member who greets you may not be your interviewer.</strong></li><br>
                <li><strong>Greet the interviewer with a firm but not crushing handshake, a warm smile, and look them in the eye.</strong></li><br>
                <li><strong>Turn your cell phone off or to vibrate</strong>, and resist the temptation to take a peek at any time before, during or after the meeting, when you are in view of the interviewer.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Exude energy, enthusiasm and a positive attitude at all times.</strong>  Employers want upbeat teen workers who don't bring any attitudinal baggage to the job.</li>
                <li><strong>Take inventory of your<a href="https://youtu.be/kayOhGRcNt4"> <em>strengths</em></a> prior to the interview.</strong>  Be prepared to describe situations where you have used your assets to get things done.  Draw upon academics, school activities, sports and volunteer work for examples, especially if you haven't held any or many jobs.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Be prepared to say why the job interests you.</strong>  You can reference things like the tasks, work environment, what you would learn and the people with whom you would interact.</li><br>
                <li><strong>At the end of the interview, be prepared to ask a few questions about the job.</strong>  Focus on issues like the nature of the work, training, supervision, clientele, and when you might expect to hear from them.</li><br>
                <li><strong>Effective follow up after your interview can separate you from the other candidates.</strong>  As soon as you leave the interview, compose a thank you note expressing your gratitude for the interview and stating briefly that you would love to work with them and why you think it's a good fit.</li><br>
